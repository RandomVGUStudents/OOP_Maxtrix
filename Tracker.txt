Checklist: ( < x > done; < o > undone )
< x > Make a main header where Identifiers.hpp; UserInterface.hpp; Calculations.hpp source from for standart like screenHeight, screenWidth, number_size, font_size, 

< x > Finish making logic for 2x2 and 3x3 determinant.

< x > Your UI should generate visual arrays of empty slots corresponding to the size of an inputted matrix. 

< o > The calculated matrix also needs to be visualized in arrays of slots, each of which represents one matrix entry.

< x > Can perform complicated calculations by facilitating parentheses for term grouping, e.g. (A + B)*C + (D - E)*F.

< o > (Priority) Can find the inverse of an invertible matrix.

< o > (Priority) Add a clear button for the matrix.

< o > Can solve a linear system.
